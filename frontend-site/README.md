## Design Notes

- The 'Battery System Overview' section has been temporarily removed from the calculator page. Revisit this design in the future to assess its value and potential improvements.
- Learnings so far: Button and badge visual balance is important for UX; subtle color gradients are preferred for non-primary actions; keep analytics sections focused and not overwhelming for users.
